# SuperShell Project Overview

SuperShell is an intelligent shell enhancement tool that provides advanced functionality to improve the command-line experience. 

## Core Features

1. **Command Interception**: The project uses a shell script interceptor that captures and processes commands before execution

2. **System Information Collection**: Gathers contextual information including:
   - Current working directory
   - File listings
   - Shell type
   - Command history

3. **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Based on the context and system information, it appears to make API requests to provide intelligent suggestions

## Technical Components

1. **interceptor.sh**: Main entry point that needs to be sourced to enable the functionality
2. **core/**: Directory containing the core functionality modules
   - suggestion.sh: Handles the suggestion system and API interactions
   - Other supporting modules

## Architecture

The system appears to follow a modular architecture where:
1. Commands are intercepted
2. System context is gathered
3. Data is sanitized
4. API requests are made for suggestions
5. Results are presented to the user

This tool seems designed to enhance the shell experience by providing intelligent assistance based on the user's context and actions.
