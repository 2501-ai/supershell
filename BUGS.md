## Known bugs
- After activating the suggestion mode, changing the prompt will not trigger the completions fetching.

## TODO
- Implement the OPT+ENTER to select the agentic prompt.

## Ideas
ZSH:
- What do we do with the API Key ? Should we prompt the user to enter it the first time ? 
- Instead of using the API Key we could use the user's IP to limit the number of requests per day ?

- It could be nice to be able to ask a question related to the prompt you are typing. For example, if you are typing a git command, you might want to ask the AI to complete your command.

- Get terminal background color to display different colors.
- Rework the display to have a one per terminal ?
- Have a curl command to install the script automaticaly.

- Have an easy way to enable/disable the script.


## Branding

Your terminal becomes a chat bot (pimp it with themes)
